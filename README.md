# OPEN-CUA: Open-Source Computer using agent 

Welcome to **OPEN-CUA** – an open-source project under HexelStudio dedicated to building a next-generation, LLM-powered browser and computer-use agent framework. Our mission is to harness the power of advanced language models to create intelligent, adaptive agents that enhance user interactions and boost computing efficiency.

## Overview

**OPEN-CUA** is designed to:

- **Empower Users:**  
  Deliver an intelligent browser that adapts to user needs by leveraging large language models. This means smarter search, on-the-fly content summarization, and contextual suggestions that evolve with your usage.

- **Enhance Productivity:**  
  Automate and streamline common computing tasks through a robust agent framework. Our agents are built to learn from your behavior and automate repetitive tasks, helping you focus on what matters most.

- **Promote Open-Source Collaboration:**  
  Foster a community-driven project where developers, designers, and enthusiasts can contribute, innovate, and shape the future of intelligent computing. We believe that collaboration is key to creating truly transformative technology.

## Key Features
